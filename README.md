# Agendas

This repository contains retrospective-like agendas for Freelancer Friday (re)Flections.

The goal of the weekly FFFs is help us look back at this week and **inspect and adapt**. We keep it to **30 mins** to make sure we're focused, and to leave a bit of time for chit-chat if we like :).

We follow this broad pattern:

- Diverge;
- Spot patterns;
- Converge.

We use the [Retromat](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/) as our main source of ideas.
